The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an uncommon error: using a vendor prefix on a property that doesn't require it.

```css
-webkit-box-shadow: 0px 0px 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);
```

This works in older WebKit browsers (like older versions of Safari), but it can lead to inconsistencies across browsers, and it's generally considered bad practice.  Modern browsers support `box-shadow` directly, and using vendor prefixes unnecessarily adds extra code and makes it harder to maintain.
